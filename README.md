# Carcará

**Carcará** is a framework for fermionic quantum simulation based on variational quantum algorithms, engineered from the ground up for deployment on real quantum hardware.


# Overview

Carcará connects theoretical condensed matter physics with NISQ-era quantum hardware. Engineered around variational workflows, the framework streamlines the pipeline from mapping complex fermionic Hamiltonians onto qubit operators to optimizing ansatz states and executing error-mitigated circuits on real quantum backends.


## Key Features

* **Fermion-to-Qubit Mapping:** Built-in, optimized transformations including Jordan-Wigner, Bravyi-Kitaev, and parity mappings to translate fermionic creation/annihilation operators into Pauli strings.

* **Hardware-Efficient & Physics-Inspired Ansatzes:** Ready-to-use ansatz generation, including Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCCSD) and hardware-efficient templates designed to minimize circuit depth and gate errors on real QPUs.

* **Hybrid Variational Solvers:** Robust implementation of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its time-dependent variants, coupled with state-of-the-art classical optimizers (e.g., SPSA, COBYLA, SLSQP).

* **Real Hardware Deployment:** Seamless integration with major quantum cloud providers (IBM Quantum Platform) with native support.

* **Advanced Error Mitigation:** Built-in noise-resilient pipelines featuring Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) and symmetry verification.
